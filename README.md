This repository includes a lot of my first learning about how to write automation using Selenium with Java.
Nearly all of these are examples taken from "Hands On Selenium WebDriver with Java" by Boni Garcia targeting his practice website.
I used this set of tests to learn how to successfully run tests remotely using Selenium RemoteWebDriver.
